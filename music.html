                                        We made these memories for ourselves
                                        Where our eyes are never closing
                                        Hearts are never broken
                                        And time's forever frozen still So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                                        Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
                                        You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
                                        And if you hurt me
                                        That's okay baby, only words bleed
                                        Inside these pages you just hold me

                                    Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
                                    And my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with
